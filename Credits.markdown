Credits for Ejectulate
======================

Ejectulate has approximate, but no literal, code from Kevin Wojniak's Semulov (New-BSD license, but no actual code used). Big thanks for when to use Disk Arbitration and when to use FileManager to eject volumes.

Ejectulate uses an expanded CollectionUtils, original from MYUtilities by Jens Alfke. License unknown.
