Credits for Ejectulate
======================

Ejectulate has approximate, but no literal, code from Kevin Wojniak's Semulov (New-BSD license, but no actual code used). Big thanks for when to use Disk Arbitration and when to use FileManager to eject volumes.

ImageAndTextCell comes from the Apple sample code project called DragNDropOutlineView.

Rogue Amoeba figured out the media key voodoo.
